The **Imagine** plugin is a CakePHP wrapper around the [Imagine image manipulation library](https://github.com/avalanche123/Imagine). It makes it very easy to manipulate image data like resize, thumbnail, crop or even to do more complex tasks like creating a photo collage. Also it abstracts the different ways, GD, Imagick, Imagick Shell to work with image data in php.
